Uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss Baby

Dog will hunt, I’m the front end loader
Travoltin’ over
So try my slam on for size
Drive stick, with that kung fu grip
Let the banana split
And watch it go right to your thighs
Cop a feel
Copperfield style
Abracadabra that bra do ya think I can pull it off
Wanna bang around
Just jot me down on your to-do list
Under "Put Out Like A Fire" ’cause
I got somethin’ and it goes thumpin’ like this
All you need is my uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss
I got somethin’ and it goes thumpin’ like this
All you need is my uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss
Uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss Baby
